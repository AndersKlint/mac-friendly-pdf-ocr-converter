Simple GUI to let users convert PDF files using ocrmypdf. Installs dependencies automatically on Mac. User friendly focused, so not optimized - it will always force OCR and optimize the output.

I had the ocrmypdf command ready, and simply let chatgpt make it into a GUI app - which might explain some weird code.
